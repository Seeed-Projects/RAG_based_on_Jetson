# RAG_based_on_Jetson
This project has implemented the RAG function on Jetson and supports TXT and PDF document formats. It uses MLC for 4-bit quantization of the Llama2-7b model, utilizes ChromaDB as the vector database, and connects these features with Lama_Index. I hope you like this project.#Jetson#Llama_index#ChromaDB#MLC
